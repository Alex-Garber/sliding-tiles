## What is it?

**Sliding tiles** is an Android implementation of the classic [_sliding puzzle_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_puzzle), or [_15 puzzle_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle). It extends the basic forms of those puzzles in 3 main areas:

* The number of tiles can be set by the user at 8, 15, 24, or 35 (3x3, 4x4, 5x5, or 6x6, respectively, with 1 open space).

* The user can select 1 of 3 included images, or any image from the Android image gallery (e.g. downloaded images, or images captured by the device camera). The puzzle tiles are formed by slices of this image; when the puzzle is solved, the complete image will be shown.

* A timer and move counter are updated as the puzzle is being solved. Thus, the user may take as their objective simply solving the puzzle, or solving the puzzle in as few moves as possible, or solving it in the least amount of time possible.  

## Who is it for?

A 3x3 or 4x4 puzzle can usually be completed in a few minutes; thus, _Sliding Tiles_ is perfect for anyone needing a quick break or distraction. Because it also exercises logical and spatial reasoning, as well as pattern recognition, it can be challenging and intellectually rewarding for those looking to practice those abilities.

Apart from our intent that _Sliding Tiles_ should be a fun and interesting implementation of a classic puzzle, the app is also intended for use in a curriculum unit of the [Deep Dive Coding](https://deepdivecoding.com/) [Java + Android bootcamp](https://deepdivecoding.com/java-android/). Through development and refinement of this app, students will explore the use of activities, fragments, navigation &amp; options menus, adapter views &amp; adapters, settings/preferences, viewmodels &amp; LiveData, persistence via SQLite with Room, etc.
